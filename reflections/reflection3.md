## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to get a lot of the functionality behind some of our components working such as the comment section, user profile images, user banner images, and the edit profile page. In terms of responsiveness, more pages are now responseive, and the learning page now has a modal that allows the user to exit out of the video they selected.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Making adjustments to the editProfile and editPortfolio page, we had a merging error this week and that took us by suprise when we went back into main. We also had challenges getting the modal to work on the learning tab, but we were able to get them working at the end.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

In terms of what we worked on this week, we feel that we were able to accomplish the tasks we set out to do. There are certain components we will continue working on throughout next week such as the liking system, functionality behind the community tab, and general styling.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

A lot of the resources we used this week came from Google searching, but we also found a lot of support from the SITE instructors. They were able to help us answer some questions we had and point us in the right direction when we felt stuck. We also found support in the labs we created before and found support in each other when one of us felt stuck.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We do not believe that any user stories are "at risk", we think that we just need the time to work on certain features we have already started working on. As the deadline approaches, we will do our best to manage our progress so that our user stories are fully addressed in our application. We will also strive to complete the marketplace feature, and if we are not able to reach this page, we will still leave what we have avaialble for users to see what direction we plan to take in the future.
