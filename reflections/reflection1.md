## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to incorporate a login/register function into our website. We were also able to finish a lot of the frontend pages. Furthermore, we were able to also incorporate the YouTube API and our security middleware is up and working.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some problems the group faced this week involved CSS styling, merging conflicts, SQL Tables, and testing.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were able to successfully complete the task we set out for in Sprint 1. We have also started working on some tasks for Sprint 2 and are making good progress with mapping out the direction we will be following for the upcoming weeks.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We used the previous labs and weekly assignments to get a good foundation for our capstone project. We were able to complete our login and register authentication thanks to our experience with past labs, and this made it easier for us to implement on our capstone. Also, practice with CSS and JavaScript in previous labs and weekly assignments helped us make a lot of progress this week. The Vaccine Hub lab was especially helpful for implementing forms and a responsive navigation bar.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Some of the features that we may consider to be "at risk" would be uploading and retrieving images and the marketplace feature. We are going to be working on storing images on Cloudinary and this is a feature we will be prioritizing as a group during sprint 2. The marketplace feature is also considered to be "at risk" because we have categorized it as a stretch feature and is something we would only get to after incorporating other features.
