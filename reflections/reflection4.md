## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to get a lot of the functionality and styling to a better place than last week! Right now we believe we have a soild MVP and besides some slight changes we plan to make to some pages, we believe we have a good foundation for our Capstone Project.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

In general we have challenges every week, sometimes those challenges take up more time to resolve than others. This week, besides some merging issue and gernal bugs we expected, we didn't have anything too troublesome. We also experinced some bugs with CSS styling but for the most part, those bugs are still in progress or in a better place now. Overall, the bugs we did experience were resolved and that helped us show our website to others after deployment.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

This week, we got a lot of the components we wanted to show our users up and running. We made the decision not to mess around too much with our Marketplace considering how much time we have left and know the potential implenting that page could bring in terms of bugs. However, we have been able to accomplish what we set out to make from the beginning when we made our wireframes.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

A lot of the resources we used this week came from Google searching, but we also found a lot of support from the SITE instructors. They were able to help us answer some questions we had and point us in the right direction when we felt stuck. We faced some hurdles with deployment and CSS but were able to resolve those issues. We also found support in the labs we created before and found support in each other when one of us felt stuck.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

At the moment, no features we wanted to implement are at risk. The only feature we have not really worked on as much would be the marketplace tab, but we will choose to leave what we have avialable to the user so they can see what we plan to implement in the future. Everything else is in a good place or is just needing to be touched up some more (styling wise).
