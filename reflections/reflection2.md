## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

One of the sucessess we have had this week includes uploading images and saving them inside the Cloudinary API. We will be working on retriving those images from the API and fetching them so that they are in their correct page. Another success we had this week was getting the YouTube API to register a string from the user and bring up videos that match that search.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some of the challenges we faced this week came from both the backend and the frontend. We had a lot of styling bugs that took sometime to figure out but nevertheless, we were able to get them flushed out. Rodrigo had a tough time understanding the different component that made a comment section, but he will be working throughout the weekend to get a more definite understanding and hopefully an actual comment section.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

As a team, we think that we completed all the task we outlined for the week. We are still working on some features, but for the most part, we have a soild start to our MVP. The features we are working on can be spread over the upcoming weeks and this would put us on track to have a soild working application by the end of week 10.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

A lot of the resources we used this week came from google searching, but we also found a lot of support from the SITE instructors. They were able to help us answer some questions we had and point us in the right direction when we felt stuck.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We do not believe that any user stories are "at risk", we think that we just need the time to work on certain features we have not had the time to fully work on yet. As the deadline approaches, we will do our best to manage our progress so that our user stories are fully addressed in our application.
