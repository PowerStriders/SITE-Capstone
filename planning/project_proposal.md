# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Brian Balthazar, Stella Kim, Rodrigo Martinez**

## Problem Statement

Help beginner artists gain exposure by helping them securely share their work with fellow beginner artists while building a sense of community.

## Description

Starting out in art and looking to gain exposure as a beginner artist can be an intimidating process amongst experienced artists. Our goal is to provide beginning artists with a place to share and explore art with other artists in the community, while also providing a sense of comfort amongst fellow beginner artists without feeling like they’re not good enough/not feeling overwhelmed or intimidated.

By making an account on our platform, artists can then share/upload their artwork, get feedback/comments, learn, view other artists' works, and participate in community forums to share their ideas/support each other.

Our target audience are beginner artists wanting to gain exposure, build a community, get support from peers, or learn art.

## What makes us different?
Our website will allow aspiring artists to explore art in a secure environment, meaning that art they make continues to belong to them even after posting it on our website. We will also allow our users to search for art tutorial videos from our site by implementing a separate tab that collects user input and works with the YouTube API to bring that video to the user.

## Open Questions

* What beginner-friendly designs will be implemented?
* What specific API will we use to upload photos?
* How to implement account creation?
* How exactly will the user's artwork be stored in our database?
* What dependencies will show up from using code from different sources?
* How fast will completing the required features take?
* What features will be available to users who make an account and those who do not make an account?
