## User Personas

**Beginner Artist/Prospective Artist**
Matt is a college student majoring in computer science who recently realized that the major didn’t fit his interests and is looking for a career change to art. Matt does not have any experience in art and is looking for a platform where he could post his artwork for constructive feedback and learn art skills to prepare an art portfolio. Changing careers and learning art can be a daunting experience and being in a community full of fellow beginner artists would provide a valuable experience.


Dobby is a highschool student living in Los Angeles. While she isn’t looking for a career in art, in her free time she enjoys doodling and wants to take it a step further. Dobby enjoys art and wants to be a hobby artist drawing fanart, but finds the amount of art resources online & experienced artists to be intimidating as a beginner/hobby artist. Finding a platform where she feels welcomed and can have the opportunity to learn with fellow beginner artists who also share her interests would provide a great gateway for her.
 

**Viewers interested in art**
Shawn is a high school student looking for inspiration to start his very own art collection sometime in the near future. Although Shawn has very little experience making art, he is hoping to find a platform that lets him explore art other people in his stage are producing. When Shawn has free time, he hopes to access a platform through his computer and admire the artwork beginning artists have published on the site or watch tutorial videos on covering artwork in a certain area of interest.

Tony is a college junior looking for a creative outlet to escape the stress of being a college student. While Tony does not have the time to start producing art himself, he is interested in the art other people make and seeing what interpretation others may have on an art piece. During his lunch breaks, Tony explores the artwork on our platform through his phone. Tony also occasionally leaves constructive criticism on posts he finds interesting during his time on the platform.
 
**Potential Buyers (Stretch Feature)**
Patricia is a small business owner from Detroit that enjoys buying art from local vendors in her free time. Patricia does not have much experience in creating art or buying art online, so she is hoping to find a legitimate platform where she can find amazing artwork from artists that are just starting out to help fund them. She knows what it is like to start with nothing, so she wants to make sure to give artists just what they need in order to help them fina	cially.

Ricardo is a college freshman from New York looking for some art to fill his college dormitory with. He is a long way from home, so he is looking for a platform where he can find artwork from artists that reminds him of home so that he will not feel so homesick. He is also looking for artists that understand what he is going through and have specific tags that mention art that can be posted in a dorm room. He also likes leaving meaningful posts about how the particular artist helped them overcome homesickness and anxiety, especially when he moves between houses or travels to visit family.
